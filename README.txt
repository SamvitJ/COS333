Commit/repo rules:

1) Every logical change (i.e. everything from a bug fix to a new feature) must be isolated in its own commit, even if the commit will only be a single line or word. This makes it easy to selectively revert changes that are later discovered to be problematic, and to identify the commit in which a particular change was made.

2) Commit messages should be capitalized and begin with a subject line of 50 characters or less that summarizes the change. The subject line should be a separated from the body with a blank line.

3) The body of a commit message, if included, should be wrapped at 72 characters.

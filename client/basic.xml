  This mirrors mini.xml, but pulls in resources from other files.

  To try it out, run:

  $ node lonely.js demo/basic.xml

  and point your browser (or browsers) to http://localhost:8080

  In a published Hangout App, resources must be hosted at a public https
  location. But for local development, it's much more convenient to use local
  versions of the resources.

  To accomodate this, Lonely uses simple rewrites. Write out the full external
  path in your XML file, then specify a rewrite which converts it to a local
  path. When you run the App with Lonely, the rewrites will be used. When you
  push the XML file to G+, the rewrites will be ignored.

  Here's what a rewrite looks like (see also the end of this file):

-->

<!-- lonely
{
  rewrites: [
    {
      from: "https://raw.github.com/danvk/lonely/master/",
      to: ""
    }
  ]
}
-->

<!--

  This is nothing more than a search/replace. It will change script sources,
  image sources and JavaScript sources, but also links and URLs in plain text.
